 The `SBAOnboardingStepController` protocol is used during onboarding to update the different model objects 
 stored on with the participant info to determine the user's onboarding state. Some values (such as name 
 and age) are saved as a part of that process. This is intended for subclasses of `ORKStepViewController`
 where the specific subclasses may not share a superclass inheritance.
